      <description>Created a tool that automatically detects whether an article is Genuine or Fake. Explored over 1,100 news articles and social network posts on COVID-19 from a variety of new sources. Engineered features from the title and text of each article. Optimised a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel and 10-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

      <description>Created a tool that separates customers into segments to distinguish them as restaurants or grocery stores,etc. Analyzed the relevance of the features for understanding the purchasing behaviours of the customers. Transformed features using Principal Component Analysis(PCA). Clustered the data using Gaussian Mixture model.    The Github link for this Repository can be found here.</description>

      <description>Created a tool that predicts housing prices to help customers negotiate the price when they buy a house. Converted continuos data into discrete values. Replaced missing values with the median value using SimpleImputer. Built a pipeline for the model. Optimised Linear, Decision Tree and Random * Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. Evaluated the model on the test set.

      <guid>https://sandeepan1999.github.io/Project-Portfolio/post/project-1/</guid>
      <description>Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job. Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.</description>
